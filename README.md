# calexicon - dates and calendars

This is package for interpretation, conversion, information and testing of calendar systems. 

 - What's this package for, doesn't everyone use the same calendar?
 - * Well everyone agrees on what today is, which is why datetime doesn't have to worry about this stuff. But not everyone agrees on what a date 2050 years ago should be called. Python datetime and Unix cal don't even agree on how many days there are in September 1752.*
